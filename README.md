Global terrorism refers to terrorism that goes beyond national boundaries in terms of the the methods used, the people that are targeted or the places from which the terrorists operate.
Global Terrorism Index is used to track countries that have been impacted by terrorism around the world.
This project was one of the three projects I studied and analysed during my internship with SMNG Academy.
In this project, I learnt how so many households, organisations, people and nations have lost lives and properties to terrorist attacks over the years.
Tool used; Microsoft Power BI.
From my analysis, many insights can be deduced such as the group with the most deadly attacks, most used weapons by these terrorists and others. Also measures can be taken to curb and mitigate these attacks.
